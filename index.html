<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
	
<p>I am a senior in the online Strategic Communication program at the University of New Mexico. I started out my studies as a Biology major with the intention of going into Veterinary Medicine but my path changed along the way. As of Spring 2022 I have an Associate of Arts degree in Communication from Central New Mexico Community College.</p>
<h2><p>HOBBIES</p></h2>
<p>I enjoy gardening and have recently taken that hobby up a notch in an attempt to start a decent pumpkin patch. I also dabble in creative writing and have self-published a few short stories. I like to joke that I write because I can't draw worth a darn, but luckily I found an artist that enjoys bringing my ideas to life. </p>
